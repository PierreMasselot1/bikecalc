Couple of tools/projects related to cycling with mainly a focus on technical implementation as well as learning new tools.

## Tire pressure calculator

Silca like pressure calculator, with with additional visualization (eg 3d map of pressure across tire width and road surface)

## Map builder

Take Strava route, transform it in a two (possibly more for elevation or other data) material object. Offer to manufacture i t, either 3D printing based or possibly do something more fancy with CNC?

Check if something similar already exists? Check if Strava integration is easy. Check if I can possibly directly advertise this with example ride from actual people?
